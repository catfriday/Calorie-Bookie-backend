# Calorie Bookie

Calorie Bookie is a web application where a user can log their daily calorie intake and bet against the calorie bookie on whether or not they reach their goal for 30 days. A user will create an account and then set a bet. The bet will be placed by putting in the amount of weight per week they would like to lose (1-2 lbs), then they will be given thier daily calorie intake limit (1200-1300 cal). Once the daily calorie goal is set, a user will bet a minimum of $100 and start a 30 day log. At the end of the 30 days, the user will win if they have completed at least 90% of their 30 day log entries and have reached their daily goal of at least 90% during the 30 days. If the user wins, they get to keep the amount they bet. If the user loses, the calorie bookie keeps the money.
